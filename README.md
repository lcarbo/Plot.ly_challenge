# Plot.ly_challenge


In this challenge, I read through a JSON of data to visualize the bacteria  found in different subjects' belly buttons (gross!). To build this interactive dashboard i used Plotly, D3, and HTML. Data on the dashboard can be filtered to show any individual subject using the dropdown menu in the upper left corner of the page.
